# Dream Vacation

A dream vacation for me would be visiting Japan. I have grown up with Japanese culture ever since I was eight years old, and would love to visit some of the hot spots in Japan (specifically Tokyo or Kobe).
In high school, I took two years of Japanese and learned some of their dialect: from saying "how old are you" to "Listen!".
